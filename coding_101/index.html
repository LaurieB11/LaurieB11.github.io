  <h1>My Greece Trip</h1>
  <h2>October 2018</h2>

  <p>We spent 7 days there and it was not nearly enough! I would gladly go back to visit again, next time for much longer!<p/>

  <h3>There are so many things to do:<h/3>
  <ul class=blockbullets>
    <li>Hike one of the stunning gorges in Crete</li>
    <li>See the ancient ruins in Athens</li>
    <li>Sit on the water and eat fresh seafood in Hydra</li>
    <li>Wander through the streets filled with brightly painted houses and shops</li>
    <li>Chat with locals in Chania about their favorite spots</li>
  </ul>
